# Project Roadmap: int2048 Big Integer Arithmetic

**Project Goal**: Implement a high-quality int2048 class that passes all 6 ACMOJ problems (2014-2019)

**Status**: Project just started - initial evaluation phase

---

## Milestone Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Basic Operations
Status: Planning

**Planned Milestones:**
- M1: TBD after initial evaluation
- M2: TBD
- M3: TBD

## Notes

**Project initiated**: 2026-02-20
**Current phase**: Initial evaluation - gathering requirements, researching algorithms, analyzing test data

**Key Constraints:**
- 6 ACMOJ problems with escalating difficulty
- Performance critical: up to 10^500000 digit numbers
- Special division behavior (floor division like Python)
- Memory limits: 47-190 MiB
- Time limits: 1-10 seconds per test
- Submission budget: 12 attempts

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete initial evaluation with team (Clara, Marcus, Diana)
2. Define first milestone based on findings
3. Begin implementation
